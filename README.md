# AI-Prediction-Model-Test-Scores
Is an AI able to predict test scores using data such as sleep time and study time? 
## Problem
What problem were you trying to solve? Why does it matter?
I am trying to solve the problem of how machine learning works by using different types of data. 

## Solution
How does your project work? (High-level, no heavy jargon)
The project works through python coding using an application called Thonny. 

## Tools
Languages, libraries, datasets, or AI models used.
The application uses python and uses different data from google sheets.

## Results - Output Screenshot
What worked? (accuracy, output, example, or result)
The AI predicted a test score of 83% for a student that slept 8 hours and studied for 6.

## Learning
One important thing you learned from this project.
What I learned from this project was machine learning.
